I'm a Postdoctoral reasearcher in Software Engineering at Université du Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust ([SnT](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/)),
under the direction of Pr. [Mike Papadakis](https://mpapad.github.io/). My research area is at the crossroad between Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) (AI4SE and SE4AI).
More precisely, my research is focused in topics centred around Software Testing applied Deep Learning models, from image classifiers to Large Language models and fostering trustworthiness and effectiveness of those testing techniques.
I'm also interested in everything related to dependability, certifiability and explainability of Deep Learning models.


I did my PhD in Software Engineering at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://polymtl.ca/en) under the supervision of Pr. [Foutse Khomh](http://www.khomh.net/) and Pr. [Giuliano Antoniol](https://gantoniol.github.io/).
and was part of the [DEEL](https://deel.quebec/en/) project, a collaboration between academics and aerospace industrials for certifiable AI systems. 

## Research Interests

AI4SE, SE4AI, Software Testing, Empirical Software Engineering, Deep Learning, Large Language Models
